# H2O Daily

## Inspiration

Nearly all of us have a hard time keeping track of things in our daily life. We've got alarms for waking up, certain hours required to take medicine. We want to make it easy to ensure the basic necessity of proper hydration.

## What it does

H2O DAILY is a simple hydration tracker that reminds the user to drink water throughout the day at whatever intervals and amounts that they set.
The user will get notifications and alerts when it is time to drink in order to reach their daily goal.
