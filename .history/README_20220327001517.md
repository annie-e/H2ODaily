# H2O Daily

## Inspiration

Nearly all of us have a hard time keeping track of things in our daily life. We've got alarms for waking up, certain hours required to take medicine. We want to make it easy to ensure the basic necessity of proper hydration.

## What it does

H2O DAILY is a simple hydration tracker that reminds the user to drink water throughout the day at whatever intervals and amounts that they set.
The user will get notifications and alerts when it is time to drink in order to reach their daily goal.

## How we built it

To begin we outlined the structure of our webpage using figma.We then proceeded to use HTML and CSS in order to build our webpage and implemented function with JavaScript.

## Challenges we ran into

In a team environment, learning quickly and adapting with new skills are crucial. We faced many conflicts on GitHub and certain challenges with JavaScript functions. However, google was always helpful in overcoming such pitfalls.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned

To never give up.

## What's next for H2O Daily by Hamstarz

The next step for H2O Daily is to add new functions and make it more interactive. We would also like to be able to add the ability to track body vitals and personal/exercise/diet habits.
