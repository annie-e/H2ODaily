# H2O Daily

## Inspiration
Nearly all of us have a hard time keeping track of things in our daily life. Thus, the idea of an alarm to wake us up and a pill organizer to take medicines. We also wanted to encourage and remind all of the basic necessity of proper hydration.

## What it does
H2O DAILY is a simple hydration tracker that reminds the user to drink water throughout the day. The user will first choose the amount of water that they aim to drink for the day. After, they will receive an alert at chosen intervals to keep hydrated. This simple and user-friendly system will allow the users to help reach their daily hydration goal. 

## How we built it
To begin, we brainstormed and outlined the structure of our webpage using Figma. We then utilized HTML and CSS to build the structure of the webpage and implemented various functions with JavaScript.

## Challenges we ran into
During the development phase, we faced challenges of resolving merge conflicts on GitHub and coding JavaScript functions, such as setting a timer according to the user's choice. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One part of the project that our team is proud of is the notification system. Although we faced challenges on the way, such as the development of the modal to be responsive to the size of the screen and the timer function for the reminder, we have managed to code it into our program. 

## What we learned
During the project, we developed various skills, such as time management and delegation of roles. We also learned how to work together efficiently and effectively to finish the envisioned project on time. 

## What's next for H2O Daily by Hamstarz
The next step for H2O Daily is to add new features to make the application more interactive. The incentivization portion for the users drinking water is currently lacking. Thus, we would like to add features to provide users with a promotion code they can use to redeem water at nearby grocery stores when they reached a certain goal. Also, we would like to explore developing chrome extensions that can send user notifications.
