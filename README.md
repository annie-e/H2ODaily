# H2O Daily

## Inspiration
Nearly all of us have a hard time keeping track of things in our daily life. We've got alarms for waking up, certain hours required to take medicine. We want to make it easy to ensure the basic necessity of proper hydration.

## What it does
H2O DAILY is a simple hydration tracker that reminds the user to drink water throughout the day at whatever intervals and amounts that they set. The user will get notifications and alerts when it is time to drink in order to reach their daily goal.

## How we built it
To begin we brainstormed and outlined the structure of our webpage using Figma. We then proceeded to use HTML and CSS in order to build our webpage and implemented functions with JavaScript.

## Challenges we ran into
In a team environment, learning quickly and adapting to new skills is crucial. We faced many merge conflicts on GitHub and certain challenges with JavaScript functions such as setting a timer for a certain period of time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Sending notification 

## What we learned
During this project, we've upgraded our teamwork skills such as time management, dividing roles, and also learned how to work together efficiently. 

## What's next for H2O Daily by Hamstarz
The next step for H2O Daily is to add new functions and make it more interactive. We would also like to be able to add the ability to track body vitals and personal/exercise/diet habits. Also, we would like to explore developing chrome extensions that can send user notifications.
